# VideoPlayerFix

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that fixes a crash in Proton by forcing libVLC on all video players, and fixes video player playback on Linux Native.

A local install of YoutubeDL is required. For distros that utilize APT:
```
sudo apt install youtube-dl
```
