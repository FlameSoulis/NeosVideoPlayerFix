# VideoPlayerFix

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that fixes a crash in Proton by forcing libVLC on all video players, and fixes video player playback on Linux Native.

A local install of [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) or [YoutubeDL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) is required for Youtube videos to work on Linux Native. 

yt-dlp installation instructions are on their Github page

YoutubeDL can be installed using APT or using the instructions on their Github page

```
sudo apt install youtube-dl python python3
```
