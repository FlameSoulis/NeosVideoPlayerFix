# VideoPlayerFix

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that fixes a crash in Proton by forcing libVLC on all video players. This can be run on Windows to force libVLC if desired, but was designed specifically to mitigate that crash.

## Building
This project is made to be built on Linux using Visual Studio Code. You will have to get the targetting pack for .Net Framework (or Mono, I don't remember how I got it to work), and manually change the references to your own.
